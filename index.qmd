Hi!

I am Fourth Year Undergraduate at IIT Dharwad studying computer Science and Engineering. I am interested in Software development. I like building things. I enjoy DSA, Graph Theory, Machine learning. Pretty much anything related to CSE!

I am currently working on Erdos-Gyarfas conjecture for P-10 free graphs as my B-Tech Project!
