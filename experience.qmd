  <h2> IIT Gandhinagar </h2>
  <p> <b>ML Research Intern</b> | May-July 2022 </p>
  - Worked with [Nipun Batra](https://nipunbatra.github.io/) on Machine Learning problems.
  - Implemented Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling on Bayesian Neural Network for bnn-zoo. The model predictions
are calibrated, and the model outputs probabilities correspond to true probabilities.
  - Contributed to [pyprobml](https://github.com/probml/pyprobml) which is code for the book ‘Probabilistic Machine Learning’ by Kevin Murphy.
